 _Def_ Problem is intractable = unlikely to be solved efficiently 
 (in time polynomial to the input size)
 
 NP = class of all search problems
 
 Search problem - rough definition - problem where we can efficiently verify solutions
 
 P = class of search problems that are solvabe in polynomial time
 
 P < NP
 
 Search Problem form:
 
 Given instance I
        -find a solution S for I if one exists
        - output No if I has no solutions
        
Examples of an NP-problem: 

-SAT (search problem, we can verify solutions in polynomial time)
-MST
